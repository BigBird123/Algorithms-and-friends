# Binary Search - Difficulty: Easy

Given an array of integers _**nums**_ which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer _**target**_, write a function to search _**target**_ in _**nums**_. If _**target**_ exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return _**-1**_.
You must write an algorithm with _**O(log n)**_ runtime complexity.

### Example:
Example 1:
    
    Input : nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
    Output : 4
    Explanation : 9 exists in nums and its index is 4
Example 2:

    Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
    Output: -1
    Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1
### Constraints

>- 1 <= nums.length <= 104
>- -104 < nums[i], target < 104
>- All the integers in nums are unique
>- nums is sorted in ascending order
